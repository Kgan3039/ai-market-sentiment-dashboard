## Phase 0 embeddings

`nlp.embeddings` provides the shared local embedding API used by the Phase 0
deduplication, clustering, and theme-stability stages. It uses
`sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` by default, loads it lazily, and
pins a model revision for replayability. It L2-normalizes float32 vectors.
Title and description whitespace is collapsed; when both are present, the
exact model input is `title + "\n\n" + description`.

Model files use the sentence-transformers/Hugging Face cache. Set
`TICKER_NARRATIVES_MODEL_CACHE` or pass `cache_location` to select a cache
outside the repository.

Persistence is intentionally behind the `EmbeddingRepository` protocol. Main
does not yet contain issue #57's write repository, so this module does not
create a parallel SQLite layer. The eventual adapter must atomically implement
`get_embedding()` and `upsert_embedding()` and persist all fields in
`PersistedEmbedding`. Unit tests recreate repository adapters over shared
in-memory backing state; they do not claim durable SQLite restart coverage.

Run the hardware-sensitive, fixture-derived warm-model benchmark separately:

```bash
python -m tools.benchmark_embeddings
```

Black-compatible Flake8 policy is committed in `.flake8`. Lint the M1 files
with:

```bash

## Phase 0 exact / near-exact dedup core (M2, issue #64)

`nlp.dedup` is the **pure core** of issue #64: stage 1 canonical-URL and
normalized-title exact match, stage 2 MinHash over normalized title
shingles. It is a function, not a service — no database, no clock, no
network, no filesystem, no model, no state between calls.

```python
from nlp.dedup import DedupConfig, RawItem, deduplicate

config = DedupConfig(supported_tickers=["TSLA", "NVDA", "AMD", "AAPL", "META"])
result = deduplicate(raw_items, config=config)
result.clusters             # deterministically ordered
result.stats                # counters, including compatibility-gate vetoes
result.provider_conflicts   # quarantined provider identities
```

**This does not close issue #64.** The DoD requires the stage to run inside
`pipeline.py`, which is issue #68 (open, blocked by #61/#62); #64 also
declares itself blocked by #57 (open). AC-3's precision/recall half needs
M4's labelled set and M3. What is here is the deduplication logic those
will call.

### Precision-first, with one gate

The core merges only mechanically obvious copies. Anything that needs an
understanding that two differently worded headlines describe one event is
M3's job — false negatives here are expected, false positives are not.

| Signal | Window | Gated |
|---|---|---|
| provider namespace + provider item id | none | no — authoritative |
| URL identity key, corroborated, both records dated | 72 h | yes |
| identical normalized title **and** description | 72 h | yes |
| identical normalized title | 72 h | yes |
| MinHash candidate verified structurally identical | 36 h | yes |

Provider identity is the one *authoritative* signal: a feed asserting that
two records are its same item. It is not time-bounded and not gated — but
only while the identity is consistent (see quarantine below).

Every other signal is circumstantial, so every other edge passes **one**
compatibility gate before it is unioned, and the gate is applied to the
**whole prospective cluster**, not to the edge's two endpoints. Checking
endpoints alone let a sparse record bridge contradictory ones — A "profit
rose", B with no description, C "profit fell" — since A–B and B–C are each
individually fine. Each component now carries an `EvidenceSummary` of every
value its members assert, and a union is admissible only when the combined
summary still holds at most one known value per field. That is exactly
equivalent to comparing every member on one side against every member on
the other, at constant cost.

The gate covers: unparseable numeric notation, text-free versus
text-bearing, protected-expression disagreement (numbers, currencies,
units, ranges, signs, percentages, quarters, years, dates), negation
disagreement, differing titles, differing descriptions. The same primitive
backs provider-conflict quarantine, which adds URL, ticker, and timestamp
checks on top — provider quarantine may be stricter than ordinary
compatibility, never weaker.

The rule is asymmetric on purpose — **explicit disagreement vetoes, missing
information does not.** So this pair stays apart even though the headlines
normalize identically:

```
title:       "Quarterly results"
description: "Profit rose sharply."   vs   "Profit fell sharply."
```

while a Reuters original still merges with a Yahoo copy carrying the same
headline and no standfirst at all.

Windows apply to the **span of the resulting cluster**, so transitive
chaining cannot widen a merge. Merges never cross a ticker.

### Provider-conflict quarantine

For each `(provider namespace, provider_item_id)` the core compares every
pair with the shared evidence primitive, then adds URL, ticker, and
timestamp checks (beyond a 1-hour tolerance). Two titles the core could not
parse — "Profit ½ higher" and "Revenue ⅓ lower" — conflict rather than
merging on the accident that neither yields an ordinary title key. On any
disagreement **every item under that identity is quarantined**: it merges through no signal at all, and is emitted as its own
cluster so no coverage is lost. `result.provider_conflicts` reports the
namespace, id, affected item ids, and the fields that disagreed.

### MinHash: real, deterministic, and honestly scoped

Stage 2 shingles the normalized title into character 5-grams, computes a
128-permutation signature from a `blake2b`-seeded universal hash family
(never Python's randomized `hash()`), and proposes candidate pairs at a
permissive estimated-Jaccard floor inside one ticker and one 36-hour
window. Candidates are then verified exactly.

**It adds no unique merge today, and nothing here claims otherwise.**
Verification requires identical normalized titles, which is the exact-title
signal, so every verified candidate is a pair stage 1 also finds and
`MatchReason.NEAR_EXACT_TITLE` is never recorded. The stage is retained
because issue #64 specifies it and because it is the point where M4's
labelled data will widen matching with measured precision. A test asserts
this equality rather than leaving it to be discovered. No LSH banding: the
issue specifies MinHash, and banding is scope the authoritative sources do
not ask for.

### Capacity: fail fast, never partial

Candidate generation is quadratic (2,000 items in one window measured ~54 s
on the dev box). A ticker partition larger than `max_partition_items`
(default 250) raises `DedupCapacityError` **before any output exists**,
carrying the ticker, the item count, and the limit. The core never returns
a result that looks complete while having skipped work; splitting the batch
or raising the limit is the caller's deliberate choice.

The provider namespace is deliberately *not* the outlet key: it applies
case, accent, punctuation, and whitespace folding only. Stripping legal or
domain suffixes would give `Acme Inc` and `Acme LLC` one authoritative
identity, letting one feed's item id merge another company's article. Being
too strict costs at most a tier-1 merge the weaker signals can still make.

### Contracts the core insists on

- **`supported_tickers` is required.** There is no default, no fallback, and
  no file to read: whoever orchestrates the core knows the approved
  universe and passes it in. It participates in the configuration
  fingerprint.
- **Every item must carry a supported ticker.** Unassigned items are the
  caller's to filter — Phase 0's relevance filter already excludes them
  from processing (spec section 2) — so the core rejects them rather than
  inventing a nameless partition.
- **Naive timestamps are rejected;** no Phase 0 contract states their wall
  clock. Aware values convert to UTC, so DST is real elapsed time.
  Timestamps outside 1990–2100 are rejected as corrupt, on absolute bounds
  so replay does not depend on today's date.
- Windows must be positive, at most two weeks, and ordered
  `near_exact ≤ exact_title ≤ content`, `url ≤ content`. **Every** signal
  except authoritative provider identity is windowed, URL included: the
  same reusable slug 180 days apart does not merge, and a URL pair with no
  usable timestamps is not a URL match at all.
- `supported_tickers` is validated against the same syntax a record's
  ticker must satisfy, and rejects duplicates that differ only in case, so
  a configuration cannot hold a symbol no record could ever match.

### URL identity

`clean_url()` (display) and `url_identity_key()` (identity) are separate.
Identity applies only transformations safe at every publisher: lower-cased
scheme and host, IDNA/punycode, valid default-port removal, fragment
removal, and a narrow click/analytics allowlist. It does **not** strip
`www.`/`m.`/`amp.` hosts or `/amp` paths, collapse slashes, normalize
trailing slashes, equate `http` with `https`, or unwrap redirect wrappers.
The query is filtered by splitting on `&` and rejoining verbatim — never
parsed and re-encoded — so `a+b` stays distinct from `a%20b`, percent
escapes keep the publisher's spelling, and repeated parameters keep their
order. Ports outside 1–65535, credentials, IPv6 literals, and unparseable
values yield `None`, meaning "no URL evidence".

### Cluster fingerprints, not story IDs

The core assigns **no** durable identifier. Each cluster carries
`cluster_fingerprint`: a full-width SHA-256 digest of the ticker and the
sorted **unique** member set, length-prefix encoded so no item id can forge
a separator boundary. The helper rejects blank tickers, blank member ids,
duplicates, and empty member sets outright. It is order-independent and independent of which
member is canonical, and it **changes when membership changes** — that is
the change-detection signal a reconciler needs. Durable `stories.id`
belongs to issue #57, and joining a run's clusters to stored rows is done
on `member_ids`.

### What a future pipeline adapter must add

Row projection from `raw_items`, provider-identity extraction from the
persisted columns, `run_log` counters, per-row error isolation, retry
handling for capacity failures, `trading_day` assignment, and the
transaction that writes `stories`. All of that is orchestration and belongs
to #57/#68, not here.
